# AutoESW
To carry out a large number of DFT calculations of ESW efficiently, an automated system for setting up and running the calculations called AutoESW was developed. The method is tailored for high-performance computing and coded in BASH for applications of high-throughput screening of battery electrolyte solvent candidates.
